# imToolBox
Image processing tool box for 4D-STEM / scanning electron nanodiffraction datasets.

To use:
1. Download the files 'imToolBox.exe' and 'imToolBox_manual.pptx'.
2. Follow the manual to set up the Matlab library (no license required) for the exe to work.

Features:
1. Works with 4D diffraction datasets in .ser/.dm3/.dm4 formats. Supports large data files exceeding the memory.
2. High accuracy strain measurement using circular Hough transform for diffraction disk detection.
3. Virtual bright field or annular dark-field imaging for the 4D datasets.
